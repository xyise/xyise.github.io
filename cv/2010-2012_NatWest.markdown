## Title

* Officially: Independent Contractor, Deputy Head
* Commonly known as: CCR Quantitative Analyst

## Summary

* Worked as the deputy head in the CCR quant team designing a suite of brand-new models for the greenfield CCR risk system, covering cross assets (rates, inflation, FX, credit) and collaterals.
* Was a key contributor in designing and creating the team's own risk engine framework (C# and SQL) to plug models in and run initial and on-going tests including backtesting. 
* Notably, wrote the risk factor simulation methodologies for inflation indices/curves and IR curves.
Engaged with the regulators (PRA), helping the firm retain the model approval (IMM). 
* Upon completion of the project, I was promoted to take the model suite over.

## The Model Suite

* Scope: 
  * risk factor simulation models: IR curves, IR volatilities, inflation rate curves, inflation indices, FX, FX volatilities, credit spreads, equities
  * pricing models: IR swaps/caps/floors/swaptions, FX forwards/options, CDSs
  * collateral modelling: VM and IM
  * testing: on-going model review, backtesting

* Skills and modelling ingredients considered for the project
  * time series analysis: AR(1), GBM, GARCH(1,1), Kalman filter
  * statistical methods: PCA, regression, maximum likelihood estimation, momentum matching estimation, hypothesis testing on multinomial distribution
  * general: Monte Carlo simulation, Nelson-Siegel parameterisation
