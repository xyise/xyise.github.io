Following the world trend, I decided to complete a course in Machine learning, and chose Natural Language Process (NLP) from Udacity nano-degree program with the following reasons: 
* The course required an intermediate level of machine learning techniques including deep learnings. So, I didn't have to start from learning the basics. 
* The subject was completely new to me, making it really "learning something new". 

I enjoyed the course throughout, and learned a lot. Specifically, the deep learning was like a magic. Transform data into tensors, apply a chain of *non-linear* functions to produce output tensors, minimise errors from true values through gradient descents and back-propagation, and *abracadabra*... It works!

I was most intrigued by the fact that we can now tackle *non-linear* problems through deep learning. Those educated in classical subjects such as maths and theoretical physics may argue the approach of deep learning is not elegant since it is difficult to see "why" the algorithm behaves in certain ways. In my opinion, however, it is a matter of *perspective* - in the end, what do I really understand? I don't even know how the keyboard I am typing works. But, I know it works. 

What matters the most is that I have enjoyed and completed this course. Here is the [certificate](https://graduation.udacity.com/api/graduation/certificate/QSC6PLGG/download).
